This also applies to the conditions of any contract made with any supplier. This agreement is made on the terms of these booking conditions, which are governed by English Law and the jurisdiction of the English Courts. You may, however, choose the law and jurisdiction of Scotland or Northern Ireland if you wish to do so. Your Rights under this agreement are set out below. A contract will exist as soon as we issue our confirmation invoice.

2. Third party rightsA person who is not a party to these terms and conditions shall have no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of these booking terms and conditions. This paragraph does not affect any right or remedy of any person which exists or is available otherwise than pursuant to that Act.

3. Supplier Terms and Conditions / Airline Conditions of CarriageThe supplier(s') Terms and Conditions and the airline's Conditions of Carriage will apply to your booking and we advise you to read these carefully as they do contain important information about your booking. Please ask us for copies of these if you do not have them.

4. PackagesA package is a booking which comprises a combination of transport (air, rail or coach) with accommodation/ car hire/ tours, where all components are booked at the same time at an inclusive price. Any booking that does not include transport, or has only one element, is not a package.

5. Your Travel Arrangement's Price & PaymentPrices advertised are inclusive of tax unless otherwise stated. Prices are correct at time of publication and are subject to change without notice. Prices are per person unless otherwise stated, and are subject to availability. Seasonal surcharges may apply depending on the date of travel. We reserve the right to alter the prices of any of the travel arrangements advertised. You will be advised of the current price before your contract is confirmed. Prices are not guaranteed until full payment is made. To confirm your travel arrangements you will be required to pay a deposit per person in addition to any applicable supplements advised at time of booking. Some airfares are booked at especially competitive rates to which the airlines may attach severe restrictions. You may be asked to pay for these in full at the time of booking and they may be non-refundable in the event of a cancellation. Details will be given at the time of booking. Please note all deposits are non refundable and non transferable. Changes in transportation costs, including the cost of fuel, taxes or fees chargeable for services such as landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airports and exchange rates mean that the price of your travel arrangements may change after you have booked. You will be advised immediately. Flight Centre (UK) Limited will collect all mandatory taxes, however some countries may charge a departure tax that must be paid locally. We advise our clients to retain sufficient local currency to meet these charges. Please note that for all bookings, a service fee from £16 will apply.

6. PaymentsFor payments by bank transfer or cheque, please ensure you check the exact amount with your travel consultant.

1. Personal (and Company) Cheques.Flight Centre (UK) Limited does accept personal and company cheques and these should be made payable to Flight Centre (UK) Limited. We require ten working days for cheque clearance before tickets can be issued and hotels booked. Please confirm with your travel consultant that there is sufficient time between cheque payment and any ticketing deadline. Foreign currency cheques are not acceptable.

3. Cash.Please do not post us cash.

5. Direct Credit/Bank Transfer.Please contact your bank for details, using our bank details as provided by your consultant. Please notify the consultant you have booked through once payment has been made.

7. Flights and Flight Travel DocumentsYour ticket and travel documents are your document of travel and the information on the ticket/voucher/invoice is deemed correct. It is your responsibility to check your air tickets and other documents immediately upon receipt. If any details are incorrect you must advise us immediately. Please note that a flight described in your flight ticket as "direct" will not necessarily be non-stop. All departure/arrival times on your flight ticket are provided by the airlines concerned and are estimates only. They may change due to air traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, operational/maintenance requirements and the requirement for passengers to check in on time. We are unable to make any special arrangements for you if you are delayed; these matters are at the sole discretion of the airline concerned.

8. If You Change Your BookingIf, after our confirmation invoice has been issued, you wish to change your travel arrangements in any way, for example your chosen departure date or accommodation, we will do our utmost to make these changes but it may not always be possible. Any request for changes to be made must be in writing from the lead named passenger. You will be asked to pay an administration charge and any further cost we incur in making this alteration. You should be aware that these costs could increase the closer to the departure date that changes are made and you should contact us as soon as possible. Note: Certain travel arrangements (e.g. Advance Purchase Tickets) may not be changeable after a reservation has been made and any alteration request could incur a cancellation charge of up to 100% of that part of the arrangements. When changing airline and train tickets we may have to rebook you to current fares, this may result in an increase in the cost of your ticket and taxes that we will have to pass on to you. These charges will be in addition to any date change penalties you were advised of at the time of booking. Please note: Name changes are not permitted in any instance. Flights must be taken in the order that they are booked. If you do not check in on a confirmed flight, the airline will register you as a 'no show' and the remainder of your ticket will be cancelled.

9. If You Cancel Your BookingYou may cancel your travel arrangements at any time. Written notification from the lead passenger and the original tickets/vouchers must be received at the branch where the booking was made. Since we incur costs in cancelling your travel arrangements, you will have to pay the applicable cancellation charges which could be up to 100%. Any refund due to you will only be paid once we have received the refund from the supplier. Please note this may take up to four months. If the reason for your cancellation is covered under the terms of your insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim these charges from your insurer.

10. If We Change or Cancel Your HolidayOccasionally, we or our supplier may have to make changes to your original booking and we/they reserve the right to do so at any time. If you have not booked a package, we cannot accept any liability or costs incurred that may result from these changes. Most of these changes will be minor and we will advise you of them at the earliest possible date.In accordance with EU Regulation 2111/2005 we are required to advise you of the actual carrier operating your flight/connecting flight/transfer. Any changes to the actual airline after you have received your tickets will be notified to you as soon as possible and in all cases at check-in or at the boarding gate.Please note that carriers such as Airlines may be subject to change. Such a change is deemed to be a minor change. Other examples of minor changes include alteration of your outward/return flights by less than 12 hours, changes to aircraft type, change of accommodation to another of the same standard or higher. No compensation will be paid for these.We also reserve the right in any circumstances to cancel your travel arrangements. For example, if the minimum number of clients required for a particular travel arrangement is not reached, we may have to cancel it. This also includes for reasons of force majeure, pandemic or epidemic illness or failure by you to pay the final balance.If you have booked a package and we are unable to provide the booked travel arrangements, you can either have a refund of all monies paid or accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements of comparable standard from us, if available (we will refund any price difference if the alternative is of a lower value). If it is necessary to cancel your travel arrangements, we will pay to you compensation.

11. Tours and ExcursionsSome tours and excursions operate with a minimum of two or more participants. In the unlikely event that the tour has to be cancelled, you will be informed immediately and your monies refunded. Excursions or other tours that you may choose to book or pay for whilst you are on holiday are not part of your package holiday provided by us. For any excursion or other tour that you book locally, your contract will be with the operator of the excursion or tour and not with us. We are not responsible for the provision of the excursion or tour or for anything that happens during the course of its provision by the operator. Local conditions can and do change, sometimes at short notice and it is possible that the program or running of any excursion or tour may be changed at short notice and sometimes without prior notification

Once we have received any refund, we will forward it onto you less any cancellation and administration charges. Refunds for part used tickets are always less than pro-rata and may have no refund value whatsoever. Refunds usually take 12 weeks to process however this may take longer. Tickets returned more than one year from date of issue are classed as expired by the airline and generally have no refund value at all.

13. Flight Reconfirmations and Schedule ChangesWe are not liable if there is any change to a departure/arrival time previously given to you or shown on your ticket. Please confirm all flights with the relevant airlines and check there have been no time changes to your original itinerary. While we will endeavour to inform you of any changes brought to our attention prior to departure, we will be unable to do so after departure. Failure to reconfirm any sector of your itinerary may result in you needing to purchase a new flight.

14. TicketingThe maximum validity for any ticket is one year. However, the majority of tickets are valid for less. For scheduled airlines, the validity of your ticket will be displayed on your itinerary.

15. Seating & Special RequestsIf you have any seating or special requests, we will pass these on to the relevant airline or supplier. Flight Centre cannot guarantee any requests as these are entirely at the airline's or supplier's discretion.

16. Baggage Allowance:If you are unsure of your baggage allowance please contact the relevant airline or your consultant.

17. Health Requirements:Health facilities, hygiene and disease risks vary worldwide. You should obtain health advice on your specific needs as early as possible. It is your responsibility to ensure you have fully complied with all health and immunization requirements of the country you are visiting. Please contact your GP.

18. Passports & Visas:It is your responsibility to ensure that you have valid passports, visas and re-entry permits which meet the requirements of immigration and other government authorities. Any fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility. We do not accept any responsibility if you cannot travel because you have not complied with any passport, visa or immigration requirements. All travellers must have a valid passport for international travel. Many destinations require that the traveller's passport has at least 6 months validity from the date of return. For travel to/via the USA a machine-readable passport is required. If you need information regarding visa and other travel document requirements for your trip please let us know. We can obtain such information from an external visa advisory service provider on your behalf. We do not warrant the accuracy of such information and accept no liability for any loss or damage, which you may suffer in reliance on it. If you wish, we can obtain visas for you through this external service and fees will apply. Please allow adequate time to obtain any such advice or documents. If you are travelling to the United States please see https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov for information regarding compulsory pre-registration for their visa waiver program. Please note, you may not meet the requirements of ESTA and may be required to obtain a visa.

19. Airline Passenger InformationSome countries and airlines are required by law to supply certain information to immigration authorities and failure to provide this information could result in the passenger being denied boarding. If you do not have this information to hand at the time of booking, please ensure you contact your consultant at the earliest opportunity. The information required is: Your passport details and country of residence and, for the USA only, the address of your first night's stay.

Out of normal office hours you may also contact our emergency assistance department on 0203 056 7993.

23. Our Liability to YouIf the contract we have with you is not performed or is improperly performed by us we will make good the arrangements or pay you appropriate compensation if this has affected the enjoyment of your travel arrangements. However we will not be liable where any failure in the performance of the contract is due to: you; or a third party unconnected with the provision of the travel arrangements and where the failure is unforeseeable or unavoidable; or unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised; or an event which we or our suppliers, even with all due care, could not foresee or forestall. Our liability, except in cases involving death, injury or illness, shall be limited to a maximum of 2 times the cost of your travel arrangements. Our liability will also be limited in accordance with and/or in an identical manner to a) The contractual terms of the companies that provide the transportation for your travel arrangements. These terms are incorporated into this contract; and b) Any relevant international conventions, for example the Montreal Convention in respect of travel by air, the Athens Convention in respect of travel by sea, the Berne Convention in respect of travel by rail and the Paris Convention in respect of the provision of accommodation, limit the amount of compensation that you can claim for death, injury, delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage. We are to be regarded as having all benefit of any limitation of compensation contained in these or any conventions. You can ask for copies of the international conventions, or the transport companies' contractual terms, from our head office at Level 6, CI Tower, High St, New Malden, UK, KT3 4TE.

24. Personal Injury Unconnected With Your Booked Travel ArrangementsIf you, or any member of your party, suffer death, illness or injury whilst overseas arising out of an activity which does not form part of your package travel arrangements or an excursion arranged through us, we shall at our discretion, offer advice, guidance and assistance.

25. Scheduled Airline Failure Administration FeeIf you are holding a ticket(s) on an airline which fails due to insolvency and has ceased flying, the money you have paid for your ticket(s) may be lost.

As part of the requirements under our Air Travel Organiser's License issued by the Civil Aviation Authority to protect our customers, Flight Centre (UK) Limited undertakes to ensure that, should this happen, our customers receive compensation for their loss to the extent referred to below.

This means that Flight Centre (UK) Limited undertakes that, in the event of a scheduled airline failure arising solely upon a scheduled airline entering into an "insolvent winding-up" (as defined by Rule 4.151 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended)) or equivalent insolvency process in any other jurisdiction other than England and Wales and ceasing to fly prior to commencement of a passenger's trip, all monies paid by the passenger either as a deposit, or as the case may be, as the price for the scheduled airline ticket(s) will be refunded to the passenger in full.

In the unlikely event of an airline failing after the commencement of your trip, please contact the store through which you booked so that the appropriate alternative arrangements can be made. You will be given the option of an alternative airline for the affected sectors. Flight Centre (UK) Limited will endeavor to keep these arrangements as close to your original itinerary as possible.

For administering both the repatriation of passengers and refunds (as explained above), Flight Centre (UK) Limited charges each customer a nominal administration fee. This fee forms part of the cost of each airline ticket purchased from Flight Centre (UK) Limited and is not optional.

26. Your Peace of MindWe are a Member of ABTA, membership number W325X (if you have booked a package). We are obliged to maintain a high standard of service to you by ABTA's Code of Conduct. We can also offer you an arbitration scheme for the resolution of disputes arising out of, or in connection with this contract. The arbitration scheme is arranged by ABTA and administered independently. It provides for a simple and inexpensive method of arbitration on documents alone with restricted liability on you in respect of costs. The scheme does not apply to claims for an amount greater than £5,000 per person. There is also a limit of £25,000 per booking. Neither does it apply to claims which are solely in respect of physical injury or illness or their consequences. The scheme can however deal with compensation claims which include an element of minor injury or illness subject to a limit of £1,500 on the amount the arbitrator can award per person in respect of this element. Your request for arbitration must be received by ABTA within eighteen months of the date of return from holiday. Outside this time limit arbitration under the Scheme may still be available if we agree, but the ABTA Code does not require such agreement. For injury and illness claims, you can request the ABTA Mediation Procedure and we have the option to agree to mediation.

Your Financial ProtectionFlight Centre (UK) Limited hold an ATOL (Air Travel Organiser's Licence), under number 4267. This is issued by the Civil Aviation Authority. Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays we sell are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected.

This lists what is are financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong If your booking is ATOL protected, we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable). If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust mat make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.
